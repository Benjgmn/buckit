Backend for the most part seems done, or at least until we find out that we might need something else done.

Our routes for buckets had to be redone to a degree, turns out anyone could access anyone's account just as long as they were logged in.

Elena was able to figure a way out to deal with the 404 error in our console, I know the instructor said he wouldn't deduct points since I am handling it but I am still extremely glad that its fixed for code cleanlyness.
