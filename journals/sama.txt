Journal Entry - Project Development Summary

STARTED 06.26.23
We kicked off the project by wireframing and setting up the database during the past week. Recently, we focused on backend authentication, making good progress together.
06.28.23
Continuing from the last entry, we spent the past couple of days diving into backend authentication.
06.29.23
Another productive day! We integrated a third-party API, updated the .env sample to .env, and started working on our films and bucket files as a team.
06.30.23
High-fives all around! We successfully completed the api/model/films functionality.
SUMMER BREAK
07.10.23
After the summer break, we regrouped and began working on backend buckets. We tackled update_bucket_name and ensured that the bucket routes worked smoothly with authentication.
07.13.23
We've been making steady progress on the functionality of the buckets. Recently, we added delete_bucket, and Ben did a fantastic job on delete_films_from_bucket on the backend.
07.14.23
Great news! Our backend functionality is now complete, and Zach made a head start on writing unit tests.
07.18.23
As we shifted to the front end, we took some time to review auth and redux lectures. Elena started with front-end authentication, and we all chipped in to get it done.
07.19.23
Front-end authentication is fully functional, including sign-up and login. Today, we also dived into Redux and React components, ironing out any issues that popped up.
07.20.23
We returned to the backend for a while to work on unit tests, fix bugs, and ensure everything was in good shape.
07.24.23
Our frontend functionality really started coming together. Zach and Elena teamed up to resolve a 422 error that was bugging us. I also managed to sort out my bug that had been lingering.
07.25.23
Ben took the lead on adding some Bootstrap styling to our frontend, giving it a polished look. We all contributed to the CSS, making the project visually appealing.
07.26.23
We conducted a thorough code cleanup, removing unnecessary print statements, console.logs, and pseudocode. Michael's suggestion to organize our frontend files was helpful, and Elena promptly handled the unit test issues.
07.27.23
We've made it! Backend finished, frontend finished, README finished, and wireframing updated and finalized. It's been a fantastic journey of collaboration and teamwork!
